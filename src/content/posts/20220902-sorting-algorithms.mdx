import SortingVisualizer from "../../interactives/sorting-visualizer/SortingVisualizer.svelte"

<div class="bg-base-300 p-4 rounded-md mb-8">
  <SortingVisualizer client:visible />
</div>

## Motivation

Sorting problem are classic introductory topic for any first-year computer science.
The algorithms are little bit intimidated at the first place, but they introduce a variety
of interesting concepts to guide students to think like programmers for better problem-solving.

My goal here is to create a tool to visualize sorting algorithms.
I hope a clear visualization can aid student to understand these algorithms. There are a lot of
website for visualizing algorithms. In fact, I already made a website for that purpose. Most of them
are just standalone websites. However, my challenge is to integrate the visualization within the blog post.

As mention on the [previous blog](/blogs/how-i-built-my-portfolio-with-astro),
I use the MDX format compose the blog posts.
MDX allow us to inject the JSX elements inside the markdown files.
For the implementation, I choose Svelte to embed interactivity within the blog post
because its simplicity.

## Features

The [visualizer](#sorting-visualizer) supports these features below

- Set the number of elements in the array (from 10 to 100 elements)
- Choose your algorithms
  - Bubble sort
  - Selection sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quicksort
  - Heap sort
- Change the sorting speed (even when the animation is running)
- Play, pause and resume the animation

## Tools I use

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for frontend UI
- For animating the sorting process, I use [function generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*)
  to create a generator function. The generator function will yield the current state of the array
  after each step of the sorting process.
