Happy π day everybody! I'm going to show you how to use serverless functions to build a quick API for find digits in π-thon.
It may not the most useful use case for the serverless functions, but it's a fun one.
More importantly, you can see the API in action with an embedded π finder in my blog below.
Just input any sequences of digits to find their positions among the first **ten million** digits in π.

The post is inspired by coding challenge [Peeking Inside Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEdpRYyjz_0)
from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)

import PiPeek from "../../interactives/pi-peek/PiPeek.svelte"

<div class="my-8 flex flex-col gap-4 rounded-md bg-base-300 p-4">
  <PiPeek client:visible />
</div>

## Ingredients for API

- [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) to build a quick Python server
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy the serverless function

## Set up

Before we start, make sure you have the following Vercel CLI installed in your machine and login.

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
```

To accelerate the development, we will use the template [Flask + Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/python/flask)
It has all the boilerplate code to deploy a Flask app to Vercel. However, the CLI does not support this template yet, so we need to copy/paste it manually.

Also, create a file named `data/pi.txt` under the root directory and store just **decimal digits** of π in it.
Now, the folder structure should look like this:

```
/
├── api/
│   └── index.py
├── data/
│   └── pi.txt
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt
└── vercel.json
```

## The API endpoint

The API endpoint is `/find/<digits>`, where `<digits>` is the sequence of digits we want to find in π.
For example, if we want to find `123` in π, we can send a GET request to `/find/123`.
The API will return a JSON object with the following information:

- `positions`: The positions of `number` in π
- `before`: The sequence of digits in π before `number`
- `between`: The sequence of digits we want to find in π
- `after`: The sequence of digits in π after `number`

## Implementation

The implementation is pretty straightforward. We need to read the file `data/pi.txt` and store all digits in the memory.
For the API route, we can use the `find` method of the string to find the positions of `number` in π.
Finally, we can return the JSON object with the information we need.

```python title="api/index.py"
from flask import Flask, Response
from os.path import join

app = Flask(__name__)

# Read the digits of pi from the file before the server starts
def preload():
  with open(join('data', 'pi.txt'), 'r') as f:
    return f.read()

data = preload()
length = len(data)
RANGE = 5

@app.route("/find/<digits>", method=['GET'])
def pi_peek(digits: str):
  # Check all characters is digit
  for c in digits:
    if not c.isdigit():
      return Response(f'Input must be a string of numbers', 400)

  # Find index of digits
  index = data.find(digits)
  if (index < 0):
    return {
      'length': length,
      'before': '',
      'between': '',
      'after': f'3.{data[:10]}...'
    }

  # Get before and after
  beforeStart = max(index - RANGE, 0)
  before = data[beforeStart: index]
  if beforeStart > 0:
    before = f'...{before}'
  else:
    before = f'3.{before}'
  afterStart = min(index + len(digits), length)
  afterEnd = min(afterStart + RANGE, length)
  after = f'{data[afterStart: afterEnd]}...'

  return {
    'length': length,
    'index': index,
    'before': before,
    'between': digits,
    'after': after
  }
```

## Deployment

To deploy the API, we can use the Vercel CLI. First, we need to log in to Vercel with `vercel login`.
Then, we can deploy the API with `vercel --prod`. Now, you can call the API with the URL provided by Vercel, with
the endpoint `<assigned>.vercel.app/find/<digits>`, where `<assigned>` is the assigned name of your project by Vercel.

For example, if the assigned name is `pi-peek`, we can call the API with `https://pi-peek.vercel.app/find/123`.
And here the result in JSON

```json
{
  "after": "71378...",
  "before": "...45047",
  "between": "123",
  "index": 1923,
  "length": 10000000
}
```

That's it! We have built a quick API to find digits in π.
