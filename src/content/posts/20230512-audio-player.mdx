When coming across different websties and YouTube videos, I see countless ways of visualizing audio
to spice up the music listening experience. I have always been curious about how I can code it for myself.
In this article, I will show you how to visualize audio waveform and frequency spectrum with Web Audio API,
HTML5 Canvas and Svelte. As you can see in my interactive demo, I also code my own audio player with Svelte,
and you can upload any audio file to play and visualize.

There are two types of audio visualization that I will cover in this article: waveform and frequency spectrum.

- **Waveform** is the amplitude of the audio signal over time. It is static and only depnends on the audio source.
- **Frequency spectrum** is the amplitude of the audio signal over frequency. It is dynamic and changes as the audio plays.

## Audio player

Before we start, let's create a global store to store the audio source and some audio states.

```ts title="audio.ts"
import { writable } from "svelte/store"

export const audioFile = writable<File>() // Audio file upload by user
export const analyser = writable<AnalyserNode>() // This will hook up with the audio source
export const isPlaying = writable(false) // Whether the audio is playing
export const progress =  writable(0) // The progress of the audio (from 0 to 1)
```

Also, we need user to upload an audio file, so let's create Svelte components for that.

```svelte title="UploadAudio.svelte"
<script>
  import { audioFile } from "./audio"
</script>

<label for="audio-file">Upload audio</label>
<input
  class="hidden"
  id="audio-file"
  type="file"
  accept="audio/*"
  on:change={(e) => {
    const files = e.currentTarget.files
    if (!files || files.length === 0) return
    audioFile.set(files[0])
  }}
/>
```
