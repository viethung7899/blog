When coming across different websties and YouTube videos, I see countless ways of visualizing audio
to spice up the music listening experience. I have always been curious about how I can code it for myself.
In this article, I will show you how to visualize audio waveform and frequency spectrum with Web Audio API,
HTML5 Canvas and Svelte. As you can see in my interactive demo, I also code my own audio player with Svelte,
and you can upload any audio file to play and visualize.

There are two types of audio visualization that I will cover in this article: waveform and frequency spectrum.

- **Waveform** is the amplitude of the audio signal over time. It is static and only depnends on the audio source.
- **Frequency spectrum** is the amplitude of the audio signal over frequency. It is dynamic and changes as the audio plays.

## Audio player

Before we start, let's create a global store to store the audio source and some audio states.

```ts title="audio.ts"
import { writable } from "svelte/store"

export const audioFile = writable<File>() // Audio file upload by user
export const analyser = writable<AnalyserNode>() // This will hook up with the audio source
export const isPlaying = writable(false) // Whether the audio is playing
export const progress = writable(0) // The progress of the audio (from 0 to 1)
```

Also, we need user to upload an audio file, so let's create Svelte components for that.

```svelte title="UploadAudio.svelte"
<script>
  import { audioFile } from "./audio"
</script>

<label for="audio-file">Upload audio</label>
<input
  class="hidden"
  id="audio-file"
  type="file"
  accept="audio/*"
  on:change={(e) => {
    const files = e.currentTarget.files
    if (!files || files.length === 0) return
    audioFile.set(files[0])
  }}
/>
```

Now, let's make the `AudioPlayer` components with two basic functions: `play` and `pause`. First, as the audio file is uploaded,
we need to create an audio source. Also, we need to create an `AnalyserNode` to analyse the audio data for later frequency spectrum visualization.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { audioFile, playing } from "./audio"

  let audio: HTMLAudioElement | undefined

  function loadAudio(file: File) {
    audio = new Audio(URL.createObjectURL(file))
    playing.set(false)
    setupAnalyser(audio) // This will be explained later
  }

  $: {
    if ($audioFile) loadAudioFromFile($audioFile)
  }
</script>
```

Then, we can create the `play` and `pause` functions.

```ts
function play() {
  if (!audio) return
  audio.play()
  playing.set(true)
}

function pause() {
  if (!audio) return
  audio.pause()
  playing.set(false)
}
```

Finally, we hook up the function with the button.

```svelte
<button on:click={$playing} disabled={}>
  {$playing ? "Pause" : "Play"}
</button>
```

Add few CSS style, you will have a basic audio player button.

### Showing progress

We can also show the progress of the audio. To do that, we need to know the current time and duration of the audio.
Let's modify the `loadAudio` function to store the duration of the audio

```ts
let duration = 0
let currentTime = 0

function loadAudio(file: File) {
  audio = new Audio(URL.createObjectURL(file))
  playing.set(false)
  timestamp = 0
  audio.addEventListener("loadedmetadata", () => {
    duration = audio?.duration || 0
  })
  audio.addEventListener("timeupdate", (e) => {
    timestamp = audio?.currentTime || 0
  })
  setupAnalyser(audio) // This will be explained later
}
```

Also, as the currentTime update, we need to update the `progress` store as well.

```ts
$: progress.set(duration === 0 ? 0 : currentTime / duration)
```

Now we can display the current time and duration of the audio.

```svelte
<script>
  // Convert time in seconds in format of mm:ss
  function displayTime(time: number) {
    const minutes = Math.floor(time / 60)
    const seconds = Math.floor(time % 60)
    return `${minutes}:${seconds.toString().padStart(2, "0")}`
  }
</script>

<div>
  {formatTime(currentTime)} / {formatTime(duration)}
</div>
```

Combining the play button, timestamp display, upload button with few Tailwind CSS styling,
we have a basic audio player showing at the bottom of the page.

## Canvas boilerplate

Before we start visualizing the audio, we need to create a canvas element to draw on.

```svelte
<script>
  import { onMount } from "svelte"
  let canvas: HTMLCanvasElement
  let ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D | null

  function updateSize(canvas) {
    canvas.width = canvas.clientWidth
    canvas.height = canvas.clientHeight
  }

  onMount(() => {
    ctx = canvas.getContext("2d")
  })
</script>

<canvas class="w-full aspect-[5/2]" bind:this={canvas} />
```

## Waveform

Again, waveform is static and only depends on the audio source. Therefore, we can create a `Waveform.svelte` component
that takes in the audio file source and display the waveform as props. To make it more interesting, we also want to reflect
the progress of the audio on the waveform as well props. Let's add these to the `script` tag of our boilerplate canvas components.

```svelte title="Waveform.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  export let audioFile: File
  export let progress: number = 0
</script>
```

Now, we need to extract the data from the audio file.

```ts
let data: number = []

const SAMPLES = 256 // Number of samples to extract from the audio file

$: {
  const audioContext = new AudioContext()
  // Async / await does not work with Svelte reactive statement, so we need to use Promise instead
  audioFile
    .arrayBuffer()
    .then((buffer) => audioContext.decodeAudioData(buffer))
    .then((audioBuffer) => {
      // Get the first channel
      const channelData = audioBuffer.getChannelData(0)
      // Sampling the data to get 256 sample points
      const samples = samplingData(channelData, SAMPLES)
      // Normalize the data to be between 0 and 1
      const max = Math.max(...samples)
      data = samples.map((sample) => sample / max)
    })
}
```

Now, we can draw the waveform on the canvas. Let's create a `draw` function that's takes `data` and `progress`
and use reactive statement to call the function whenever `data` or `progress` changes.

```ts
function draw(data: number[], progress: number) {
  if (!ctx) return
  updateSize()
  const { width, height } = canvas
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)
  const w = width / data.length // The width of each bar
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    const h = data[i] * height // The height of each bar
    const x = i * w // The offset of each bar
    const y = (height - h) / 2 // Align the bar to the center of the canvas
    const color = i / data.length < progress ? "red" : "gray" // Color the bar based on the progress
    ctx.fillStyle = color
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, w, h)
  }
}

$: draw(data, progress)
```

To render the waveform, we can simply pass in the `audioFile` and `progress` props.
You can render the prompt to upload audio file if the `audioFile` is not provided.

```svelte
<script>
  import { audioFile, progress } from "./audio"
  import Waveform from "./Waveform.svelte"
</script>

{#if $audioFile}
  <Waveform audioFile={$audioFile} progress={$progress} />
{:else}
  <!-- Prompts to upload audio file -->
{/if}
```

Here's the final result.

import Waveform from "@/interactives/audio/Waveform.svelte"

<Waveform client:load />

## Frequency spectrum

Frequency spectrum is dynamic and changes as the audio plays. It requires us to use `AnalyserNode` to extract the frequency data
with `getByteFrequencyData` method. The frequency data is an array of 8-bit unsigned integers (0-255) that represents the amplitude.

First of all, let's implement loadAnalyser function that takes in the audio source and store the result in the store.

```ts title="audio.ts"
// ... More stores
export const analyser = writable<AnalyserNode>()

export const FFT_SIZE = 256

export function setupAnalyzer(audio: HTMLAudioElement) {
  const context = new AudioContext()
  const source = context.createMediaElementSource(audio)
  const analyserNode = context.createAnalyser()
  analyserNode.fftSize = FFT_SIZE
  // Connect the audio source to the analyser node
  source.connect(analyserNode)
  // Connect the analyser node to the destination (i.e. speakers)
  analyserNode.connect(context.destination)
  analyser.set(analyserNode)
}
```

Now, we can create a `FrequencySpectrum.svelte` component that takes in the `analyser` store and display the frequency spectrum.
Since the frequency spectrum is dynamic and depends whether the audio plays, we need to pass `isPlaying` as well. Let's add these props to the component.
Also, we need to create a `data` state as to store the frequency data, and decay factor to make the frequency spectrum fade out over time if the audio is paused.

```svelte title="FrequencySpectrum.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { FFT_SIZE } from "./audio"
  export let analyser: AnalyserNode
  export let isPlaying: boolean

  const DECAY_FACTOR = 0.95 // The decay factor of the frequency spectrum
  let data: Uint8Array = new Uint8Array(FFT_SIZE / 2)
  let decay = 1 // The decay of the frequency spectrum

  let animationFrame = 0 // The animation frame id
</script>
```

Next, we create a function that takes in the `data` and draw each frequency bar on the bottom of the canvas.

```ts
function draw(data: Uint8Array, factor: number) {
  if (!ctx) return
  updateSize()
  const { width, height } = canvas
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)
  const w = width / data.length // The width of each bar
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    const h = (data[i] / 255) * factor // The height of each bar
    const x = i * w // The offset of each bar
    const y = height - h // Align the bar to the bottom of the canvas
    ctx.fillStyle = "red" // Your color of choice
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, w, h)
  }
}
```

When the audio is playing, we need to update the `data` state with the frequency data from the `analyser`.

```ts
function updateData() {
  analyser.getByteFrequencyData(data)
  decay = 1
  draw(data, decay)
  animationFrame = requestAnimationFrame(updateData)
}
```

Otherwise, we need to decay the `data` state and redraw the frequency spectrum.

```ts
function decayData() {
  decay *= DECAY_FACTOR
  draw(data, decay)
  animationFrame = requestAnimationFrame(decayData)
}
```

Finally, we can use reactive statement to call the `updateData` or `decayData` function based on the `isPlaying` state.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  //...
  $: {
    cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrame)
    if ($isPlaying) updateData()
    else decayData()
  }
</script>
```

Now, we can render the frequency spectrum with the `analyser` and `isPlaying` props.

```svelte
<script>
  import { analyser, isPlaying } from "./audio"
  import FrequencySpectrum from "./FrequencySpectrum.svelte"
</script>

{#if $analyser}
  <FrequencySpectrum analyser={$analyser} isPlaying={$isPlaying} />
{:else}
  <!-- Prompts to upload audio file -->
{/if}
```

Here's the final result.

import FrequencySpectrum from "@/interactives/audio/FrequencySpectrum.svelte"

<FrequencySpectrum client:load />
