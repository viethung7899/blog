description: Use Satori and Astro static endpoints to generate OG images from the blog content
---

When you share a link to any social platforms (such as Twitter or Facebook),
viewers can see a preview card with a thumbnail image and few relavent information.
That thumbnail image is called an **Open Graph image**, or OG image for short.

In this tutorial, I will show you my approach to generate OG images from the blog post content from my Astro blog.

## Ingredients

Since this blog is written in Astro and all blogs is statically generated, we want all the OG iamges to be generated in build time (i.e. static generation).
Here are all the ingredients we need:

- [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) by Vercel is a powerful tool to generate images from HTML templates and CSS styles.
- [Astro Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) featured in Astro v2 is a tools to managing content, such as blog posts, in Astro.
- [Astro endpoints](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/endpoints/) allows us to create endpoints that serve any types of data other than HTML pages.
  In this case, we need to create PNG images.

## Setup

First, we need to install these packages as develper dependencies (I use `pnpm` as my package manager, but you can use `npm` or `yarn`):

```bash
pnpm add -D satori satori-html sharp
```

- [`satori`](https://github.com/vercel/satori) is the main package to generate SVG images from HTML templates and CSS styles.
- [`satori-html`](https://github.com/natemoo-re/satori-html) is a plugin for `satori` to construct SVG images with string literals.
- [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) is a high perfomance NodeJS image processing tool, and we will use it to convert SVG to PNG.

## Image generation

Overall, the image generation process is as follows:

1. Load the data
2. Create HTML template
3. Convert HTML template to OG image

To start off, we need a route to serve the OG image.
In my case, I want to host these images inside the blog post route, the route name would be `/posts/[slug]/og.png`.
So, we need to create a file `posts/[slug]/og.png.ts` under the `pages` directory with these two functions.
Also, the path contains dynamic parameters, so we need to export `getStaticPaths` function to generate the list of paths.

### Load the resource

We utilize the Astro Content Collections API to load the blog post data.
We generate the list of paths from post collection, and pass the metadata as props to the `GET` function.

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection("posts")
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
    props: {
      data: post.data,
    },
  }))
}

type Props = InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticPaths>
```

### Create HTML template

The next step using `satori-html` package to create the markup with semi-friendly HTML template literal syntax.
Luckily, we can use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to quickly style the markup with the `tw` attribute supported by satori.

```ts
import { html } from "satori-html"

// ...

export async function GET({ props }: APIContext) {
  const { data } = props as Props
  const date = new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", {
    year: "numeric",
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
    timeZone: "UTC",
  }).format(data.date)
  const tags = data.tags?.map((tag) => `#${tag}`) || []

  const markup = html` <div tw="w-full h-full flex flex-col justify-between p-16 text-white">
    <div tw="text-4xl font-bold text-teal-400">${logo}</div>
    <div tw="flex flex-col">
      <div tw="text-4xl font-semibold">${data.title}</div>
      <p tw="text-xl opacity-80">${[date, ...tags].join(" · ")}</p>
    </div>
  </div>`

  // More code...
}
```

Adding image to the markup is a little bit tricky. We need to use `url` function from for the `background-image` CSS property.
The easy way is to upload the image in the cloud storage and use its absolute URL.
However, I want to keep the image within the source code, and working with local images is much harder.
My approach is to convert the image to base64 string and use it as the url for the `background-image` property.

Let's use this image below for the background and save it as `og-background.png` in the `src/assets` directory.

![Background image for OG image with color gradient and noise texture](../../assets/og-background.png)

Here is the code.

```ts
import { html } from "satori-html"
import { readFileSync } from "fs"

const imageBase64 = readFileSync("src/assets/background.png").toString("base64")

export async function GET({ props }: APIContext) {
  // ...

  const markup = html` <div
    tw="w-full h-full flex flex-col justify-between p-16 text-white"
    style="background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,${imageBase64}')"
  >
    <div tw="text-4xl font-bold text-teal-400">${logo}</div>
    <div tw="flex flex-col">
      <div tw="text-4xl font-semibold">${data.title}</div>
      <p tw="text-xl opacity-80">${[date, ...tags].join(" · ")}</p>
    </div>
  </div>`

  // More code...
}
```

### Convert markup to images

The last step is very simple, we just need to convert the SVG to PNG image.
Satori requires the font buffers to SVG generation. There are two ways to do this:

- Load the font files from the file system (using Node.js `fs`)
- Load the font files from the web (using `fetch`)

In my case, I go with the first option.
I use the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) font with three variants (regular, <span class="semibold">semi-bold</span>, and <span class="bold">bold</span>)
and save them in the `src/assets/fonts` directory.

```ts
const regular = readFileSync("src/assets/fonts/Inter-Regular.woff")
const semibold = readFileSync("src/assets/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.woff")
const bold = readFileSync("src/assets/fonts/Inter-Bold.woff")

const fonts = [
  {
    name: "Inter",
    data: regular,
    weight: 400,
  },
  {
    name: "Inter",
    data: semibold,
    weight: 600,
  },
  {
    name: "Inter",
    data: bold,
    weight: 700,
  },
]
```

In the end, we want our image has the size of 1200 &times; 630 pixels.

```ts
const DIMENSIONS = {
  width: 1200,
  height: 630,
}

// @ts-ignore
const svg = await satori(markup, {
  ...DIMENSIONS,
  fonts,
})

const png = sharp(Buffer.from(svg)).png()

return new Response(await png.toBuffer(), {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "image/png",
  },
})
```

## Result

Voilà! We successfully generated the OG image from the blog post content.
Here is an example of generated image from this post.
